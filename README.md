# Waveform Art

I have a blank wall in my house that needs a piece of artwork. After looking online I thought it would be cool to have an image of a waveform.

This project uses scipy and matplotlib to read a waveform and plot it to an image.

## Development

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python main.py
